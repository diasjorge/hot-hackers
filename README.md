# Hot hackers (jot jaquers in Spanish)

This application was developed during Conferencia Rails 2010, in Madrid, Spain.

The idea is that you have a match between two hackers and you vote for your favourite one based on the information they have on their github profiles or just based on whatever you want ;)

### KNOWN ISSUES:

The application is deployed at heroku so we don't load compass on production. The stylesheets need to be compiled manually before deploy.
